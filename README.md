# NLP-Powered Financial Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis tool for financial news and social media data. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify financial texts into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

## Features
- Preprocesses financial text data using NLTK
- Implements TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Uses a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) for sentiment classification
- Visualizes sentiment distribution and word clouds
- Provides a confusion matrix for model evaluation
- Includes a function for predicting sentiment on new texts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning (TfidfVectorizer, LinearSVC)
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- WordCloud for generating word clouds

## Dataset
The project uses the Financial PhraseBank dataset, which contains sentences from financial news categorized into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud tqdm
3. Download the Financial PhraseBank dataset and place it in the project directory as 'Sentences_AllAgree.txt'

## Usage
Run the main script: python financial_sentiment_analyzer.py

This will:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Train the model
3. Evaluate the model's performance
4. Display visualizations
5. Provide example predictions

## Model Performance
The LinearSVC model achieves [insert accuracy here] accuracy on the test set. Detailed performance metrics are provided in the classification report generated by the script.

## Future Improvements
- Implement BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for potentially improved performance:
  - Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the financial sentiment dataset
  - Compare BERT performance with the current LinearSVC model
- Expand the dataset with more recent financial news and social media data
- Implement real-time sentiment analysis on streaming financial news
- Develop a web interface for easy interaction with the model
